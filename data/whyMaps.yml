content: |
  Maps and GIS software have become an integral
  technology for thousands of organizations across the globe.
  At <a href="/">MAP-LAB</a>,
  we believe remote work
  and the new hybrid office environment
  has created major challenges for
  organizations to effectively communicate
  using maps and share valuable insight from
  their existing geospatial data and analytics platforms.
  We're passionate about helping organizations
  adapt to this new work environment
  through online collaborative GIS tools that
  promote discovery, insight, and discussion.
